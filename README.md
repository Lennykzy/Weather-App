# Weather App
In this tutorial,   I am going to show you how to code a weather 
app with JavaScript. In this tutorial, we also use a weather API and we get data from API❗️

## Warning
It would help if you got your API key (in the video we showed how!) and replace it in the index.js file on line 9 :

```JavaScript
const API Key = 'Your Api Key';
```
